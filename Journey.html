        Outsourced Couriers: Longtime employees who served the company for decades
        Family said nothing

        Second time it became abundantly obvious that the family will not stick up for me or Idelta or anybody

        Prisca was the designated ministry contact person, and Idelta was told not to contact Ministry without going through Prisca.

        Idelta was given an ugly choice between reporting to Neil, and being treated as his personal assistant in front of ELT members and staff, or being subjected to Pierre's public bullying and harrasments, and the family said and did nothing

        Prisca and Aimy was acting as CIO, and Brian was not allowed to speak to Leica or other vendors without Aimy' approval

        Brian was forced to compete with Jerry and Iain and their friends through outsourcing, and family said nothing

        Brian needed to defend his interests and software ownership against Jerry and Iain and their friends:

        -- May 2023 Pierre & Andrea signed the contract to build new Pathology LIS, and Brian wanted co-ownershipl
        -- September 2023 Neil & Andrea signed replacement agreement to build LIS and WF and wanted full ownership

        Appointing Brian as Acting co-CEO on Idelta's reccommendation

        -- Stoped all invoices
        -- Stopped sales conversations with prospects
        -- Took leave of absence at personal cost of 12K / months to dedicate time to turn ALpha around
        -- Worked tirelessly
        Visit SCCS with Idelta to
        Held staff hands and looked in their eyes to asked them for forgiveness and for a chance to fix things and to earn their trust again
        Staff sent messages thanking and said Idelta and Brian saved the company (from union attack)
        -- Negotiated hard with Joel to try and save the pathology business
        -- Came up with contingency plans to get around equipment manufacturers's delay and start the pathology lab asap
